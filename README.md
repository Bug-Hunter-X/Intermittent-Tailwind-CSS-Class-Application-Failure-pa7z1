# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to elements.  The issue is intermittent and the root cause is currently unknown.  The `bug.js` file contains example code exhibiting the problem, and `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround or fix (if found).

## Bug Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a webserver (e.g., `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
3. Open the `bug.html` file in your browser.
4. Observe that the styling might not apply correctly in a non-deterministic fashion.

## Potential Causes

* Incorrect configuration of Tailwind CSS.
* Conflicts between Tailwind classes.
* JavaScript interference modifying the DOM after Tailwind has run.
* Browser caching issues.
* Issues with Tailwind plugin usage or configuration.

## Possible Solutions (if found)

* See `bugSolution.js` for any proposed solutions.

## Further Investigation Needed

A deeper investigation will be needed to determine the definitive cause and implement a robust solution.
