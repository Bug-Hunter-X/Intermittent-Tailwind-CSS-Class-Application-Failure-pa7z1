// Potential solution (replace with actual solution if found). This might involve:
// 1. Verifying Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project.
// 2. Checking for conflicts in CSS class order or selector specificity.
// 3. Ensuring no JavaScript is overriding the Tailwind styles.
// 4. Clearing browser cache and restarting the development server.
// 5. Inspecting the browser's developer tools to see if any CSS rules are overriding the Tailwind classes.

// Example:  If the issue was due to a conflict with another CSS framework, this might involve carefully combining classes from both frameworks to avoid overriding.
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 other-framework-class">
  <p>This text should have a red background and padding, and other styles.</p>
</div>
